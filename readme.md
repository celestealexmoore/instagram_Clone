# instagram_Clone

### _This application is a (very basic) clone of Instagram built with React, Tailwind CSS and Firebase. I don't anticipate finishing until 6/15, so please check back!_

This project uses React (custom hooks, useContext, useState, useEffect, useRef), Firebase (Firestore/auth), Tailwind CSS, LoadTest, Lighthouse, Vercel, React Testing Library and Cypress E2E Testing.

This project has multiple pages: Login, Sign Up, Dashboard (to view/like/comment on photos), and User Profiles. The sign-in page connects to Firebase when a user tries to sign in, and when a user signs up, Firebase Auth is used to store the user in the Firebase Auth Database.
